### Teaching

Getting to teach physics, astronomy, and scientific computing is one of my favorite things about my job. I love interacting with students, and coming up with new ideas for curriculum. I am always challenging myself to find simpler, more concise ways to communicate ideas.

As a graduate student at NYU, I was the teaching assistant for computational physics for four consecutive years. I also TA'd core physics courses like electromagnetism and fluid dynamics. As a postdoc, I have guest-lectured in a number of undergraduate and graduate courses at Stanford University and Columbia. I also did outreach work in California state prisons.

In Fall 2017 I taught a course for the [Columbia Science Honors Program](http://www.columbia.edu/cu/shp/), called _Hydrodynamics in Nature_. This program is for advanced high school students in and around NYC. The course description is below:

>This course will explore principles of hydrodynamic flow, in the context of earth, space, and medical science. Hydrodynamics aims to understand the movement of liquids and gases. We see examples of hydrodynamic flow all around us, in our homes and cities, and in our planetâ€™s rivers, oceans, and atmosphere. The blood flowing through our veins, and gas motions in stars and galaxies can also be understood through hydrodynamics. Hydrodynamic flows are also beautiful and mesmerizin and have captured the imagination of thinkers and artists throughout human history. Most classroom learning will be at a visual and conceptual level, although algebra, geometry and calculus may be utilized depending on student experience. Optional assignments may include reading or computer projects, or using photograph or video to capture fluid flows in nature.
