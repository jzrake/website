### Still writing this...

<!-- ### Preface
This article is adapted from a colloquium I gave at [Bard College](https://www.bard.edu) in March, 2019. I had a great time doing the research for that talk, so I decided to collect some of the material to share here. It is mostly intended for a general audience, but some undergraduate physics background might be helpful in places.

I also have in mind first-year graduate students who are beginning a research program in transient or multi-messenger astronomy. There are links to a handful of historical papers throughout the talk, which you might consider following if you're a graduate student.

My goal is to add some historical context to the advances made in high-energy astrophysics following the first detection, in Agust 2017, of gravitational waves from a coalescing binary neutron star system. This event has sparked a renewed interest in many aspects of gamma-ray burst research. It is also, hopefully, only a glimpse of the discovery science that will be enabled by upcoming detections of similar events, both by gravitational wave observatories, and across the electromagnetic spectrum.


### Flashes in the sky
My particular area of research involves events known as gamma-ray bursts, or GRB's. GRB's are flashes of high energy radiation coming to us from deep space. Lucky for me, GRB's have been the subject of much of the recent excitement, and we are at a stage where an increasing number of the major questions about their origins are being resolved.

To appreciate the significance of the current events, I feel it is most enlightening to visit the history of how GRB's were first discovered, and how our modern understanding of what they are has evolved.


### The Ivy Mike test of 1952

The story of how people first became aware of gamma-ray bursts goes back to the Cold War, when the US and the Soviet Union were locked in an escalating contest to produce the biggest, most threatening nuclear detonations.

This is an image of the Ivy Mike test, carried out over the Pacific Ocean by the US in 1952. This was the first test of a thermonuclear device - an H bomb. It was different from the tests that came before it because the energy yield came from nuclear fusion rather than fission. Images like these fueled public concerc about the potential dangers of nuclear weapons testing — including the possibility of accidental detonations, of radioactive fallout in the atmosphere, and habitat destruction.

This concern led to the signing, in 1963, of the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, which was signed by the US and the Soviet Union, and prohibited nuclear testing in the atmosphere, in the oceans, and in outer space.


### Energy scales
The topic of nuclear explosions is an opportune moment to introduce some energy scales that will be relevant throughout the talk.

The Ivy Mike test was roughly 10 megatons. A megaton, in turn, is roughly the energy released in the ignition of 1 million tons of TNT. Its SI equivalent is 4 billion Joules. For some (insane) reason, astronomers measure energy in units of erg, which is one ten-millionth of a Joule. Whereas a Joule is a kilogram-meter-squared-per-second-squared, an erg is a gram-centimeter-squared-per-second-squared. The energy released by a powerful hurricane is something like a billion times larger than a nuclear detonation - roughly 10^26 erg. And, the energy radiated by the sun throughout its 10 billion year lifetime is another 10 trillion trillion times greater than that, roughly 10^51 ergs.


### The Vela program
Anyway, in order to monitor compliance with the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, the US undertook Project Vela, to be overseen by a team of scientists at the Los Alamos National Laboratory. Project Vela built a dozen satellites, to be flown two-at-a-time in a high-earth orbit and which were equipped with X-ray and gamma-ray detectors that would be sensitive to the signature of a nuclear weapons test. No weapons tests were definitively identified by the Vela missions.

However, on July 2nd, 1967 both of the satellites in orbit at that time registered a 2-second long pulse of gamma-rays. This caught the attention of the Los Alamos scientists as unusual; it was too long to be from a nuclear weapon. Furthermore, analysis of the arrival direction of the photons revealed they did not come from the surface of the earth, but from outer space.

The Los Alamos scientists determined the gamma-rays were not a threat, and decided to monitor and catalogue them for clues as to their origin. After 6 years, perhaps a hundred burst candidates were collected. 16 of them were, with very high confidence, not coming from the earth or the sun. These events were referred to as "gamma ray bursts of cosmic origin", and they were announced in a letter to the Astrophysical Journal in 1973.


### Early days of GRB theory (1)
This announcement generated great excitement in the astronomical community, and prompted theorists to propose an impressive variety of scenarios that might explain the bursts.


### Early days of GRB theory (2)
This is a partial listing, compiled in a 1994 review article on GRB's, of the models that been proposed up until that time.

The list included an amazing variety of ideas, including

1. Charged, intergalactic dust grains entering the solar system and evaporating
2. Comets crashing into neutron stars
3. Chunks breaking off of neutron stars, flying into space and exploding
4. Supermassive black holes collapsing at the centers of far away galaxies

... and many other exotic and improbable scenarios. Indeed, the 1994 review article continues on like this for four pages.

A useful means of classifying the proposed ideas was by their distance scale - how far the progenitor (the object producing the burst) was from the earth. Of the ideas highlighted here, the progenitors were either

1. Somewhere in our solar system
2. Throughout the galactic disk
3. In the outskirts of the galaxy, a region called the halo
4. Spread out across the observable universe, perhaps billions of light-years away

If you look at the list, you'll see that neutron stars are mentioned frequently. They are dead stars, left behind as the byproduct of certain types of supernova explosion. They are generally 1-2 times the mass of the sun, but they are very small — typically 10km across, roughly the size of Manhattan.


### Magnetar flares
These ideas involving neutron stars were well motivated! There was another class of event, now referred to as giant magnetar flares (magnetars are a fancy name for ultra-magnetized neutron star), which were known to come from neutron stars. The first of these giant magnetar flares was detected in March of 1979, when an extreme pulse of gamma rays, of higher intensity than any of the GRB's, swept through the solar system, saturating the gamma-ray detectors on interplanetary probes as it passed by.

The pulse looked like this, and it was traced to an ancient supernova remnant (called N49) in the Large Magellanic Cloud, a dwarf galaxy in orbit around the Milky Way. There are perhaps 10-15 magnetar candidates spread out throughout the disk of the Milky Way.

So, did GRB's and magnetar flares have a common origin? Were the GRB's coming from neutron stars that were perhaps just a little farther off than the galactic magnetars?


### Problems with the magnetar hypothesis: the light curves
There were a number of problems with the magnetar hypothesis. One was the incredible diversity of the GRB light curves — as you can see, some of these were single pulses, others had long, declining tails, and many showed violent, random variability on millisecond time-scales.

Meanwhile, the light curves of giant flares commonly exhibited modulations with a well-defined period. For example, the 1979 event showed these 8-second wiggles in its light curve. These are connected to the rotation period of the star. The explosion produced a hot-spot on its surface, which comes in and out of view as the star rotates.

Another problem with the magnetar hypothesis was that magnetar flares were seen to recur — sporadically but unambiguously from the same object. GRB's were never seen to happen twice at exactly the same point on the sky.


### Problems with the magnetar hypothesis: isotropy
Yet another problem with the magnetar hypothesis came from data was emerging gradually throughout the 80's and 90's as more and more bursts were detected. The GRB's were coming equally from all directions on the sky (they were isotropic). All the known magnetars were sitting here, in the disk of the Milky Way.


### The cosmological origin hypothesis
Because of the differences between the light curves of GRB's and magnetar flares, and because of the isotropy of the GRB population, the idea that GRB's came from the distant universe (that is, they had a cosmological origin) began to gain attention.

This is because the universe is, at very large distances, homogeneous and isotropic. That means it looks basically the same from one place to another, and that it has no top-bottom, left-right, or front-back.

These are images of the infrared universe, and of the cosmic microwave background radiation. Such observations support the isotropy of the universe at very large scales.


### The Lamb-Paczynski debate
The quesion of the GRB distance scale was addressed in a famous debate in 1995, between Donald Lamb and Bohdan Paczynski. These debates were moderated by some of field's most recognized contributors: Martin Rees and Virginia Trimble.

Both participants put forward their strongest arguments. Lamb, in trying to rescue the magnetar origin hypothesis, tried to account for their isotropy on the sky by arguing that an otherwise invisible population of ancient neutron stars was hiding out in the galactic halo. They got there, he argued, by receiving kicks from the supernova explosions in which they were born, causing them to go whizzing off, out into the galactic halo, where they sat producing gamma-ray bursts to bewilder and entertain astronomers.

He also pointed out that for any explosion to be detectable from across the universe, its luminosity scale would need to be unthinkably large — releasing perhaps 10^52 ergs in less than a minute - more than the sun radiates in 10 billion years. If the explosions were so powerful, one could reason out a contradiction with the rapid variability seen in their light curves. The contradiction arises from a well-known connection between the size of a light source, and the maximum frequency with which it could be observed to flicker on and off. The only way out of the contradiction was to have a less energetic explosion, or, as Paczynski pointed out —

To stipulate that the explosion accelerate gas to very nearly the speed of light. If that were the case, then the frquency of the flickering appears much faster than it actually is, because of the effects of relativistic time dilation (a consequence of Einstein's special theory of relativity).

Thus Paczynski, in advocating that GRB's came from across the universe, had the isotropy argument on his side. However, his critics were skeptical of the immense luminosity scale this implied, and by the additional requirement that the explosions accelerate gas to very nearly the speed of light.


### The afterglow problem
There was something else that made the study of GRB's so difficult. It was the lack of any emission at other wavelengths. The fact that every time a burst occurred, nothing, other than the gamma rays lasting seconds to minutes, could be detected in that part of the sky. If there was some type of an afterglow: a longer-lived counterpart to the GRB, that would help ground-based telescopes with far better angular resolution to pinpoint the location on the sky, and look for anything else unusual in the vicinity of the source.

The major missions that flew in the 1990's were designed with this in mind, with the hope of identifying a GRB afterglow.


### The first afterglow: GRB-970228
The hunt for afterglows became a success in early 1997, when BeppoSAX triggered on GRB-970228, turned its X-ray camera in the general direction of the burst, and caught a fading X-ray signal in the same part of sky. The additional sky localization enabled by the X-ray afterglow narrowed the search area for ground-based telescopes. About two weeks later, at the beginning of March, the Keck telescope discovered a fading optical image coincident with the X-ray afterglow. It also found a faint galaxy there (the first host galaxy), and after very deep observations could measure the spectrum, and the redshift of that galaxy. GRB-970228 came from 8 billion light years away!

Two more afterglow detections were made in 1997 — one in May and another in December, and these discoveries ended the debate over the GRB distance scale.


### Search for the central engine
The fact that GRB's were cosmological left theorists with the challenge of explaining the incredible energy scale ~10^52 ergs. This happens to be roughly the energy released in a supernova explosion, and this was taken as a strong clue that there could be a connection between GRB's and supernovae.

There were two major problems, however: (1) a supernova and GRB had never been seen to occur together, and (2) supernovae had never been seen to accelerate gas close to the speed of light — a requirement reasoned from the variability time scale of the light curves.

I am showing here two nearby supernova remnants in (and around) our galaxy, a mere thousands of light-years away. Had either of them produced a GRB like the ones seen from billions light-years away, it would have ionized the earth's atmosphere and almost certainly ended human life on Earth.

So, there would have to be something different about the supernovae that produced GRB's, if they came from supernovae at all.


### GRB-980425
The connection between GRB's and supernova explosions was solidified with the supernova 1998bw, which appeared in the same part of the sky, at just the right time (roughly 2 weeks) following GRB-980425. GRB-supernovae are now observed routinely, and there is something unusual about them:


### The Type Ic SNe
They lack the signature of hydrogen and helium in their spectra. The envolope of a massive star looks like an onion: with an iron core, zones of silicon, oxygen, neon, and carbon, and with outer layers of hydrogen and helium. Most core-collapse supernovae (those responsible for the birth of neutron stars) contain hydrogen absorption lines in their spectra. However, a small fraction are lacking hydrogen, and an even smaller subset are also lacking helium. It's this latter bunch, designated as Type Ic's, that are seen to be associated with GRB's.

This suggests something different about the stars that go on to become GRB progenitors. Most likely they have blown away this outer envelope in the final stages of the lives. This is a first clue as to the GRB central engine.


### Hints from the afterglows
A second clue came from the careful analysis of the afterglows. Some of them were inferred to be unreasonbly powerful — apparently releasing as much as 10^54 ergs. Also, some of them evolved over time in a way that suggested the explosions were not spherical, but aspherical, or even tightly collimated — and pointing in our direction! Were that the case, it would mean that when we see a GRB, we are looking down the barrel of the gun so-to-speak.

Or, a more serene analogy might be a light house. If you were in its beam, you might easily assume that the light source was spherical. Were you to make that assumption, you'd infer the light house in the picture was perhaps a 100 times more powerful than it actually is... because it's focusing all of its power shining a light directly at you!

So, what in nature might be a like a lighthouse?


### AGN jets
Here's something! This is an image of a radio galaxy in the constellation Cygnus. It's called Cygnus A. This object is roughly a million light-years from end-to-end. Down there at the center, is a galaxy that hosts a supermassive black hole, containing a mass a billion times that of the sun. The jets are plasma streaming away from the black hole at nearly the speed of light, accelerated by the energy released as matter falls into the black hole.

Now imagine if we saw this object from a different angle. There are such sources out there! They are called blazars.

So, what if...


### The collapsar model
A black hole somehow formed inside of a star?

Is this crazy? Most likely, yes. But let’s consider it anyway.

We know that neutron stars are born in core-collapse supernovae. What if instead of a neutron star, the core of the star collapses into a black hole? And, what if that black hole begins eating the star from the inside out, and releasing that energy in the form of jets that drill through the star, and break out in a collimated explosion?

That might look an aweful lot like a GRB.


### Stan and Andrew
And it's exactly what theorist Stan Woosely, and his graduate student Andrew MacFadyen, were thinking about at UC Santa Cruz in 1999. They called this scenario the collapsar model.


### How does a jet escape a star?
One of the biggest criticisms of the collapsar model was how to get a jet out of a star. Wouldn't the star absorb the energy of the jet, and not allow it to break out?

Computer simulations like this one, led by Weiqun Zhang, demonstrated some surprising consequences of relativistic hydrodynamics, including that fact that shock waves could help focus the jet as it drills, causing it to preserve its energy rather than wasting it, say expanding or heating up the star.

In fact, this scenario was most likely to work when the star had its outer envelope of hydrogen and helium! So many pieces of the collapsar model fit perfectly with the association of GRB's with Type Ic supernovae.

The collapsar scenario is, 20 years later, still the favored model for the GRB central engine.


### Short bursts
Ok, I lied. The collapsar model only accounts for 60% or 70% of the bursts.

Since 1993, it had been known that there were two types of GRB’s. The bursts on the left are less than two seconds in duration, while the ones on the right are typically 10 — 1000 seconds, and there are unmistakeably two distinct groups here. The short bursts tend to have more energetic emission spectra and unlike the long ones, show no connection with supernovae. They also come from galaxies of all types and all ages, while the long ones come only from young galaxies that show signs of vigorous star formation.

These facts all pointed to a distinct class of progenitors for the short bursts. The favored explanation, proposed by Bodhan Paczynski, was that the short bursts came from the coalescence of two neutron stars.

The energy scale was correct, and binary neutron stars exist, and will merge! But how do we know? To understand this, we need to begin discussing the other half of this talk — gravitational waves.


### Gravitational waves: definition
Gravitational waves are 'ripples' in the curvature of space. Albert Einstein predicted their existence in 1916, by inspecting the mathematical structure of his general theory of relativity, published the year before. There are a number of analogies between the gravitational and electromagnetic radiation. Both types of waves travel at the speed of light. EM waves are produced wiggling charges, while gravitational waves are produced by wiggling masses.

Also, both are transverse waves, meaning that the wave displacement is in the direction orthogonal to that of the wave's propagation. However, what exactly is oscillating is quite different. With EM waves, it is the electric and magnetic field vector that oscillate (the electric field in one direction and the magnetic field perpendicular to it). With gravitational waves, it is the length of an object that oscillates in time. If I stand with my arms outstretched facing an oncoming gravitational wave, then my arms are lengthened and then contracted in turn, while my legs do the same, 90 degrees out-of-phase.

Also like EM waves, GW waves carry energy. This means that rotating masses, like a binary star system, slowly spiral inwards toward one another as they radiate gravitational waves. This is also true of the earth going around the sun. But, the separation is so large and the orbiting so slow, that the rate of inspiraling is too small to be detectable.


### Gravitational waves: orbiting stars
However, if a massive system were orbiting fast and close (like the one in the animation), then their inspiraling might be detectable. And, as their orbit quickens, so does the gravitational wave power! So it creates a run-away effect where the two bodies eventually plunge inwards and coalesce.


### The Hulse-Taylor binary
A system with just these properties was discovered by Russell Hulse and Joseph Taylor at the Arecibo Radio Observatory in Puerto Rico in 1974. They discovered a binary neutron star system with an 8 hour perdiod, just short enough that its quickening might be detectable if the system were monitored precisely over several years.

A speed-up of the binary orbit was not only detected, but it matched with astonishing precision the predictions of general relativity. This system will merge in 300 million years!

Hulse and Taylor were awarded the 1993 Nobel prize for this discovery, as it not only confirmed a fundamental physics theory, it also was the first proof that binary neutron star systems exist, and that at least some will merge within the age of the universe.


### Simulations of BNS mergers / GW's and the kilonova
This is a computer simulation of a coalescing binary neutron star system, made by researchers at the Albert Einstein Institute. On the right, it shows matter that has been dynamically expelled by tidal forces ripping the stars apart. On the left is a depiction of gravitational waves generated by the stars as they in-spiral and collide.

Computer simulations like these helped theorists to make predictions about what observers should look for.

The amount of material expelled by tidal forces indicated how bright a radioactive transient might be. Nuclear astrophysicists anticipated it would be 1000x brighter than a classical nova (perhaps 10-100 times weaker than a supernova), but a bit shorter (lasting perhaps a week rather than 3-4). This prediction was referred as a kilo-nova.


### LIGO: laser interferometer gravitational wave observatory
These simulations also predicted the frequency, duration, and characteristics of the gravitational wave signal that would be detectable by gravitational wave antennas like the LIGO detectors in Louisiana and Washington state, shown here.

The signals predicted by the computer simulations were incorporated into the algorithms used by LIGO to comb their data for potential sources of gravitational waves.


### The first binary black hole merger detection
The first direct detection of GW’s was made on Sept. 14, 2015 by the LIGO detectors in Hanford, WA and Livingston, LA. It was the signal of a coalescing binary black hole system roughly 1.4 billion light years away.

LIGO’s discovery of merging black holes was groundbreaking, but it was in a sense, audio-only. LIGO scientists recorded the "sound" of merging black holes, but as was anticipated, there was no electromagnetic signal accompanying it. That is, nothing that could be seen through a conventional telescope. This is because black holes likely merge without much gas around them. Without any gas, there’s nothing to heat up and glow.

Merging neutron stars, on the other hand (recall — the favored candidates for the progenitors of short duration GRB’s) are made of matter, and as we saw, the computer simulations indicated that they produce quite a mess when they merge, with many proposed electromagnetic counterparts, including short GRB's and the kilo-nova.


### GW170817
The lucky day came toward the end of LIGO’s second observing run, in mid August, 2017.

This figure represents historical data: the very first joint detection of gravitational and electromagnetic radiation from a single source. LIGO captured the final minute or so of the in-spiraling stars, and the so-called GW chirp — which occurs just as the stars begin to combine into a single object. About 2 seconds following the chirp, the space-based gamma-ray observatories Fermi and INTEGRAL both detected a gamma-ray burst, coming from a similar part of the sky.


### Discovery of the IR/Optical/UV transient
The GW and EM detections, including estimates for the sky position of the source, were broadcast to observing groups around the world. It was a difficult search, because the “error-box” on the sky was large — about 150 times the area of the full moon, and also because it was close to the sun. This meant that ground-based telescopes would only have a few hours after sundown to take images, before the source set below the horizon.

Impressively, 6 different observing teams — all furiously imaging catalogued galaxies in the error box, looking for a splotch of light that was absent from the archival images — discovered the source between 11 and 13 hours following the initial trigger. The match between the spectral and temporal properties of this transient, and what was predicted by the kilo-nova theory, was uncanny.

Here is a question: why did this GRB, which was the first joint GW and EM detection ever made, also happen to be the closest to the earth?

— It could be a coincidence.

— Or, it could be that the progenitors of many GRB’s have been this close, we just didn’t know it!

Indeed, many short bursts lack distance measurements, because their afterglows are never found. Recall that without an afterglow, we don’t have a host galaxy, and without a host galaxy, there is no way to measure a redshift. Redshift measurements are made from atomic emission and absorption lines in the galaxy’s light, while the GRB spectrum itself does not have these lines (the emitting gas is fully ionized plasma).

Had LIGO not been running, and detected the GW’s associated with GRB 170817A, it would almost certainly have been one of those bursts with no detected afterglow, without a host galaxy, without a redshift, and whose distance from earth would never be found out. Instead, the GW detection made by LIGO narrowed the source location on the sky, helping observers to find its afterglow. This is an example of the incredible value in astronomical sources that are detected with multiple "messengers."


### Was GW170817 similar to the progenitors of typical short bursts?
The neutron star merger that powered the August 2017 event event occurred very nearby, only 130 million light years away! If it was intrinsically like other short bursts, it should have been hundreds of times brighter than it was. So in the aftermath of the 2017 event, astronomers were left wondering whether or not this event was a good representation of the progenitors of short bursts seen from much farther away.


### An explanation for the dim GRB
Maybe there was a bright GRB, just not for us! If there was a relativistic jet, but one that was pointed somewhat off the line-of-sight, then perhaps some alien astronomers, somewhere else in the universe, but in the "beam of the lighthouse", saw a bright GRB, and we only saw a very dim one.


### The possibility of VLBI observations
How would we be able to find out?

The radio through X-ray afterglow of GRB-170817A continued to be observed for over a year after the event. If the explosion really expanded at nearly the speed of light, then it would have grown to be a light-year in diameter by last summer. At a 130 million light years away, the remnant would occupy a few milli-arcseconds on the sky — roughly a billion times smaller than a full moon.

Impressively, such small objects can, in some cases, be resolved on the sky using a radio imaging technique known as VLBI, for very long baseline interferometry. VLBI uses a network of radio telescopes spread out across the continent to form what is effectively a single, huge telescope, with incredible angular resolution.


### Simulating the jet: movie
Anticipating the possibility of VLBI observations, my colleagues and I performed computer simulations of a jet launched into the environment of a BNS merger. We then synthesized radio images of how that jet would appear to VLBI telescopes here on earth a year later.


### Simulating the jet: plot of the images
This is what we found: if there was an off-axis jet in the BNS merger, then the centroid of the radio emission would be offset from the explosion site by 4-5 milli-arcseconds, and that offset should grow over time.

Shortly after we published our predictions of how the remnant would appear if it had an off-axis jet, VLBI observations were published with many of the same features. In fact, they found the radio centroid had moved farther than our simulations predicted. This erased any doubt that GRB-170817A, though apparently dim for us here on earth, could have been seen as a powerful GRB by observers that were in its beam.
