<h3>About me</h3>
<p>I am a postdoctoral research scientist in the physics department at Columbia University. I did my doctoral work with Andrew MacFadyen from 2007 --- 2013 at New York University, and was a Kavli Fellow at Stanford University and SLAC from 2013 --- 2017.</p>

<p>I do reseach in high energy astrophysics --- which deals with observing and interpreting the universe in its most extreme environments. My favorite topics are gamma-ray bursts, relativistic jets, pulsar wind nebulae, binary neutron star mergers, and circumbinary black-hole accretion disks.</p>

<p>Most of my work involves developing, and running, computer software to simulate these environments. I'm a proponent of good software practices, and try I follow advances in modern C++.</p>
